# KnapsackAI

The Knapsack is a classical NP-Complete problem that consists of fullfilling a collection of limited size given a list of itens with determined sizes and values, trying to maximize the value inside the collection.

This project was made as the first assignment of the Artifcial Intelligence discipline ministred in the first semester of 2019 at the University of São Paulo Campus São Carlos.
